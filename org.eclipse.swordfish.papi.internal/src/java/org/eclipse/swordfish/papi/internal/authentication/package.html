<p>This package provides interfaces to implement authentication
handlers to be used within SBB instances, services, and service
operations.
<p>Authentication handlers need to implement the {@link
org.eclipse.swordfish.papi.authentication.AuthenticationHandler} interface.</p>
<p>The application developer registers an implementation of the
authentication interfaces with the SBB. SBB then invokes this handler when
authentication information, such as user credentials, is required.</p>
