This package provides the implementation of the PAPI extension specified in sbb-papi-extension-instrumentation.
The services offered here can also be used by internal SBB components. To do this use the interfaces defined in
this package (and not in org.eclipse.swordfish.papi.extension.instrumenation). Get an instance of the InstrumentationManager
from Spring via
<pre>
ctx.getBean("org.eclipse.swordfish.core.management.instrumentation.InstrumentationManager")
</pre>
and register your managed components as described in InstrumentationManager's Javadoc.
